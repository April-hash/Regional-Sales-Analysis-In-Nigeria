## Findings

1. Product Model Performance
   
Top-performing models:
>     •	3002C and 3002P record the highest unit sales, indicating strong market demand.
>     •	5001C also performs well, suggesting consistent customer preference.
Low-performing models:
>     •	2500C and 4500P have the lowest unit sales, indicating weaker demand or limited market acceptance.
Insight:

> 	  •	North East and South West also show strong performance.
> 	  •	North West records the lowest units sold, indicating weaker market penetration.
Insight:
> 	  •	Sales performance varies significantly by region, likely influenced by population density, store presence, or economic activity.

3. Revenue Distribution
>     •	North East generates the highest revenue, even though it does not sell the most units.
> 	  •	South West and South South also contribute significantly to total revenue.
> 	  •	North Central, despite high unit sales, does not generate the highest revenue.
Insight:
> 	  •	Some regions sell higher-value products, not just higher quantities.



4. Day Categort Impact

## Conclusion
> The analysis shows that sales performance is mainly driven by a few high-performing products, strong regional differences, and higher activity on workdays. While some regions sell more units, others generate more revenue due to higher-value products. Focusing on top products, optimizing regional strategies, and prioritizing workday sales will improve overall business performance.
